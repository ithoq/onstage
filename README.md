onstage
=======

onstage is a simple event importer and manager built with Codeigniter

Currently it has only 3 controllers:
home
eventos
import -> This one uses Spark library and Simplepie RSS to import last.fm events


On April 2014 Bonfire HMVC was added to have a new administration:
https://github.com/ci-bonfire/Bonfire

If you want to get links to your events local site you can do so posting the event in [onstagekonzerte.de](http://onstagekonzerte.de)
Just send me a twitter message or a github message and I will create you an user for the events administration panel.

This is an open project. Fell free to fork it, copy, modify it, use it for own city or for anything else that you have in mind.
